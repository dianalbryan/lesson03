            As a student I began with a focus on world literature in order to better work with a more multicultural environment. The subjects I forcused on tended to be involved with how different cultures both work together and sometimes have difficulty in their interactions. In my teaching my focus remained on maintaining a welcoming multicultural environment for our increasingly diverse students. I found a love of graphic design while making lesson plans and curriculum.</div></div>
